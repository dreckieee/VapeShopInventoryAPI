# Vape Shop Inventory API

ASP.NET Core Web API for inventory management — built for a real Vape Shop business.

## Status: Deployed
Product CRUD, Expense CRUD, and full Sale/SaleItem lifecycle (create, add/reduce items, close, cancel) are complete and tested end-to-end — 11 automated tests via `WebApplicationFactory` against an isolated in-memory database, plus manual verification against the live deployed instance. Live on a DigitalOcean droplet as of Day 94.

## Tech Stack
- .NET 10 / ASP.NET Core (Controllers)
- Entity Framework Core
- SQLite

## Live Deployment
- Hosted on a DigitalOcean droplet (Singapore region), running as a systemd service on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
- Swagger UI is deliberately enabled in Production for demo accessibility (not standard practice for a real production API)
- **No authentication is implemented** — a deliberate scope choice for this portfolio demo, not an oversight. A production deployment would require auth before any public write access
- The live URL is intentionally not published in this README — used for direct demos (e.g. interviews) rather than left publicly discoverable, given the lack of authentication

See [DECISIONS.md](./DECISIONS.md) for design rationale, known issues, and deployment history.

## Endpoints

### Products
- `GET /api/Products` — list all products
- `GET /api/Products/{id}` — get product by id
- `POST /api/Products` — create product (returns `400 BadRequest` on invalid input)
- `PUT /api/Products/{id}` — update product
- `DELETE /api/Products/{id}` — delete product (returns `409 Conflict` if the product has existing sale item references)

### Expenses
- `GET /api/Expenses` — list all expenses
- `GET /api/Expenses/{id}` — get expense by id
- `POST /api/Expenses` — create expense
- `PUT /api/Expenses/{id}` — update expense
- `DELETE /api/Expenses/{id}` — delete expense

### Sales
- `POST /api/Sales` — create a new sale
- `GET /api/Sales/{id}` — get a sale with its items
- `PATCH /api/Sales/{id}/date` — edit the sale date
- `POST /api/Sales/{id}/close` — finalize a sale, decrementing stock
- `PUT /api/Sales/{id}/cancel` — permanently cancel an open sale

### Sale Items
- `POST /api/Sales/{saleId}/items` — add an item to a sale
- `PATCH /api/Sales/{saleId}/items/{itemId}/reduce` — reduce an item's quantity

## Testing
`VapeShopInventoryAPI.Tests` — 11 NUnit tests (4 Products, 7 Sales/SaleItems) using `WebApplicationFactory<Program>` against an isolated in-memory SQLite database. Run with `dotnet test` from `VapeShopInventoryAPI.Tests` — no separate server needs to be running first.

## About

## How to Run Locally
`dotnet run`, then open `http://localhost:{port}/swagger` (check terminal output for the exact port).
